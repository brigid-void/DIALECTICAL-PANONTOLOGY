1. **God is Dead**
    
    - Aligns with your **Nonnegotiable #1** (_natura naturans_ as sole divinity).
        
    - _But_: Nietzsche’s Übermensch risks anthropocentric exceptionalism (**Nonnegotiable #3**).
        
2. **Will to Power ≈ Natura Naturans**
    
    - His cosmic vitality mirrors _natura naturans_’ self-creation (**Lexicon**).
        
    - _But_: His individualism contradicts _anatta_ (**Atom #5**).
        
3. **Amor Fati & Dialectical Suffering**
    
    - "Love of fate" resonates with **Rule #8** (suffering/joy co-arise).
        
    - _But_: His aristocratic ethics clash with Marxian dialectics.
        

**Verdict:** Nietzsche is a _provocateur_, not a pillar. Mine him for aphoristic force (e.g., "become what you are" → **kenosis**), but sterilize his individualism.

**Note**: Nietzsche represents to me the furthest extreme of rogue Ego-Geist complex, driven by dread towards individualist will to power instead of praxis in alignment with the dialectic of flux.
