1. **Transcendental Dualism**
    
    - Kant’s _noumenon/phenomenon_ split violates **Nonnegotiable #2** (rejection of dualism) and **#9** (nondual monism).
        
    - Your framework rejects any "unknowable reality" beyond material dialectics.
        
2. **Anthropocentric Morality**
    
    - His categorical imperative centers _human reason_ as moral arbiter—clashing with **Nonnegotiable #3** (anti-exceptionalism).
        
    - For you, ethics emerges from cosmic unfolding, not rational axioms.
        
3. **Static Categories**
    
    - Kant’s _a priori_ concepts (space/time/causality) imply fixed structures, contradicting your **Rule #3** (process precedes substance).
        

**Verdict:** Kant’s architecture is antithetical to your fluid, materialist monism. _Exclude._

**Note:** I personally think Kant fits in similar to any other anthropocentric view, like Abrahamic faiths. Made lesser, and understood as non universal.
