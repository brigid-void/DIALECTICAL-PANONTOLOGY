# Jean-Paul Sartre (1905-1980)

## Core Contributions to Dialectical Panontology
- **Existence Precedes Essence**: The radical freedom of human consciousness to create meaning in an absurd universe.
- **Bad Faith (Mauvaise Foi)**: The self-deception of denying one's freedom and responsibility.
- **The Look (Le Regard)**: The dialectical relationship between self and other that constitutes intersubjectivity.
- **Nothingness (Le NÃ©ant)**: The nothingness at the heart of being that makes freedom possible.

## Key Connections to Dialectical Panontology
- [[04_EGO_AS_GEIST]]: The ego as a project rather than a substance, constantly transcending itself.
- [[02_NONDUAL_ONTOLOGY]]: The tension between being-in-itself (en-soi) and being-for-itself (pour-soi).
- [[10_ANTHROPOCENTRISM_REJECTED]]: The human condition as both facticity and transcendence.
- [[15_VIRTUE_AS_DIALECTICAL_ALIGNMENT]]: Authenticity as alignment with one's radical freedom.

## Critical Engagement
