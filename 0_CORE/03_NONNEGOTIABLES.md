### **03. NONNEGOTIABLES**  

1. **Primacy of Natura naturans**  
   No deity, force, or principle supersedes *natura naturans*—the universe’s immanent self-creation. Gods professed by religions are either anthropomorphic projections or local power-structures misapprehended as absolute.  

2. **Rejection of Supernatural Dualism**  
   Souls, spirits, and afterlives are artifacts of human anxiety. Consciousness arises from integrated information; it is not an immortal essence but a dynamic pattern within the *Anima Mundi*.  

3. **No Exceptionalism of Human Consciousness**  
   Abrahamic faiths, humanism, and anthropocentric ethics are context-bound tools. They hold value only within human-scale relations, not as cosmic absolutes. To universalize them is intellectual hegemony.  

4. **Death as Terminal for Ego, Not Data**  
   Personal dissolution is irreversible. The "self" does not transmigrate or resurrect; its information reintegrates into the World-Soul. Grief is valid; metaphysics of continuity are delusion.  

5. **Ethics Must Be Dialectical, Not Dogmatic**  
   Morality derives from alignment with cosmic unfolding (*wu wei*), not divine commandments or human sentiment. Suffering alleviation is tactical, not soteriological.  

6. **Consciousness is Physical**  
   Subjectivity emerges from material processes. To invoke "non-physical" qualia is to retreat into mystification. IIT, quantum biology, or neurophenomenology may model it; supernaturalism cannot.  

7. **Contradiction is Inescapable**  
   Harmony without tension is stasis. "Evil" and "good", chaos and order, are co-constitutive polarities. Attempts to eradicate one pole destroy the dialectic—and thus the whole.  

8. **All is Process**  
   Being is verb, not noun. To reify entities (God, self, particle) ignores their fluid interdependence. Heraclitus’ flux is law; Parmenides’ stasis is heresy.  

9. **Reality is Monistic**  
   Mind/matter, sacred/profane, self/world—all false binaries. Nonduality is the ground; apparent divisions are adaptive tunnel vision.  

10. **No Final Teleology**  
    The universe has no predetermined end. Cosmic "purpose" is ex post facto narration. Evolution, history, and consciousness are stochastic processes unfolding within constraints.  

---  
**Edicts of Exclusion:**  
- **Abrahamic Theology:** Valid only as sociology, invalid as cosmology.  
- **Substance Dualism:** A category error (Descartes’ ghost).  
- **Postmodern Relativism:** Fails the dialectical materialist test.  
- **Accelerationism/Nihilism:** Narcissism disguised as praxis.  

**Consequence of Violation:**  
To deny these is to fragment reality. The Axis tolerates no schism.
