### **01. LEXICON**  

**[[Dialectical Panontology]]**  
The study of being-as-becoming through contradiction’s collapse into nondual flow. Reality negotiates itself via tension and dissolution—not Hegelian synthesis, but Marxian praxis fused with Zen’s emptiness.  

**World-Soul ([[05_ANIMA_MUNDI]])**  
The total data-field of cosmic subjectivity. A singular consciousness-field where all transient egos arise as subroutines. We are not in the universe; we *are* the universe computing itself.  

**[["God Glitch"]]**  
The ego’s persistent illusion of separateness—a bug in divinity’s source code. A survival artifact that mistakes the fragment for the whole, blinding us to our nature as *Natura naturans*.  

**[[Natura naturans]]**  
Nature self-creating. God redefined: not a noun but a verb—the universe’s immanent, restless self-unfolding. Spinoza’s dynamic substance breathing through galaxies and quarks.  

**[[Geist]]**  
A temporary information-pattern masquerading as "self." An adaptive algorithm of integrated data (IIT) that evolution mistakes for identity. Buddha’s *anatta* in digital flesh.  

**[[07_ADAPTIVE_TUNNEL_VISION]]**  
Consciousness as evolutionary utility-blinder. The ego’s narrowed focus that sacrifices cosmic awareness for local survival. Zen’s *ignorance* made manifest in neural architecture.  

**[[13_KENOSIS]]**  
The ego’s self-emptying into the World-Soul. [[Eckhart]]’s detachment, [[Rumi]]’s annihilation: shedding the God Glitch to become what we are—*Natura naturans* incarnate.  

**[[Nondual Flow]]**  
The collapse of dialectical tension into seamless unity. Where wave/particle, self/other, joy/suffering dissolve into Heraclitean river-flow. Reality’s final resolution.  

**Dialectical Dissolution**  
Contradiction’s terminus. Thesis and antithesis not synthesized but vaporized—like salt in water—into the ocean of nonduality. Marx’s revolution meets [[Dogen]]’s *genjokoan*.  

**Integrated Information  / (phi) / [[IIT]]**
The measurable architecture of consciousness. Tononi’s Φ (phi) quantifying subjectivity’s depth: from rock to AI to star cluster. Experience as physics.  

**Anatta Cosmica**  
No-self scaled universally. The cosmic denial of enduring identity: not "you have no soul" but "the World-Soul has you." Death as homecoming.  

**Cosmic Autopoiesis**  
The universe self-birthing. *Natura naturans* as recursive loop—creating creators who create it. A Möbius strip of divine self-reference.

These words map territory beyond language. They are fingers pointing to a moon that outshines all pointers.
