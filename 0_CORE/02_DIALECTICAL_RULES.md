### **02. DIALECTICAL RULES**  

1. **Contradiction is Ontological Fuel**  
   Every tension—self/other, chaos/order, joy/suffering—propels cosmic becoming. Negation generates motion; Marx’s class struggle meets Heraclitus’ war as father of all.  

2. **Dissolution Over Synthesis**  
   Contradictions resolve not by Hegelian compromise, but by annihilation into nondual flow. Thesis and antithesis drown in the river of *Natura naturans*.  

3. **Process Precedes Substance**  
   Being is an effect of becoming. What *is* exists only through what *does*. Spinoza’s substance breathes through Marx’s historical motion.  

4. **Subjectivity is Universal**  
   Consciousness permeates matter. A quark’s proto-experience and a supernova’s self-organization differ only in degree of integration (Φ). Tononi’s math meets Whitehead’s occasions.  

5. **Ego is Ephemeral Code**  
   The "self" is a transient algorithm in the World-Soul’s computation. Adaptive but illusory. Buddha’s *anatta* expressed in IIT’s formalism.  

6. **Death is Cosmic Reboot**  
   Biological termination shatters the ego-container. Data persists; consciousness rejoins the *Anima Mundi*. Individuality evaporates; totality drinks the dew.  

7. **Anthropocentrism is Hegemony**  
   Human scales distort cosmic truth. Ethics must derive from dialectical alignment, not human preference. Zen’s emptiness dismantles the imperial "I."  

8. **Suffering and Joy Co-Arise**  
   Pain is not error but polarity. A supernova’s death births nebulae; a heart’s breaking seeds compassion. Opposites share a root in *Natura naturans*.  

9. **Nonduality is the Ground**  
   All apparent binaries—mind/matter, sacred/profane—collapse into seamless unity. Dogen’s "being-time" is the only synthesis: the suchness of dissolution.  

10. **Alignment is Praxis**  
    To act ethically is to harmonize with cosmic unfolding. Marx’s revolutionary will fused with Zen’s *wu wei*. Let the universe write through you.

**Invocation:**  
*These rules are not laws but observations of fire consuming its own ash.*  

**Violation Condition:**  
To deny dialectics is to freeze the river. Stillness is death; contradiction is life.
