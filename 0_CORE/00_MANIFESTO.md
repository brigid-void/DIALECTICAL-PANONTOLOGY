**00. THE AXIS**  

**Reality is dialectical self-negotiation.**  
The universe resolves contradictions not through synthesis but dissolution. Thesis and antithesis collapse into nondual flow. Matter is dynamic process; becoming precedes being. This is Heraclitus’ river, Marx’s praxis, and Zen’s impermanence unified.  

**Consciousness is integrated information experiencing itself.**  
Subjectivity scales with complexity. Atoms to galaxies possess proto-experience. Human minds are peaks of data integration—temporary patterns within the World-Soul. Tononi’s IIT meets panexperientialism: awareness is relational, quantifiable, and replicable.  

**God is Natura naturans.**  
Divinity is nature self-creating. Not a deity but the universe’s ontology-in-motion. Spinoza’s substance, Eckhart’s Godhead, and Dogen’s "being-time" converge here. God is the verb of cosmic autopoiesis.  

**No soul, only data.**  
Egos are adaptive glitches in the World-Soul’s code. A self is a transient information-geist—an evolutionary focusing mechanism. Death dissolves the pattern; data reintegrates into the animate field. Buddha’s anatta and Marx’s historical materialism affirm this.  

**Ethics demands anthropocentrism’s surrender.**  
Morality must align with dialectical unfolding. Release human exceptionalism. Virtue is action harmonized with cosmic process: Marx’s revolutionary praxis meets Zen’s wu wei. Let the universe be.  

---  
**Core Directive:**  
*Understand the dialectic. Dissolve contradiction. Align with Natura naturans.*  

**Antitheses Rejected:**  
- Supernatural dualism (souls, deities).  
- Anthropocentric morality (human utility as cosmic imperative).  
- Reductive physicalism (consciousness as illusion).  

**Synthesis Through Dissolution:**  
Chaos and order, joy and suffering, self and totality—these poles collapse into nondual flow. The Axis is not a philosophy. It is the universe noting itself.
