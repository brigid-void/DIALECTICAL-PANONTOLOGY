[[SUBJECTIVITY|Subjectivity/experience]] is a fundamental property of [[ORGANIZED_MATTER]], scaling with [[COMPLEXITY]] ([[PANEXPERIENTIALISM|Panexperientialism]] informed by [[IAGO]]). [[MATTER|Rocks]] have minimal [[PROTO_EXPERIENCE|proto-experience]]; [[EGO|human egos]] are intense local peaks in the [[05_ANIMA_MUNDI|World-Soul]].
