[[PAIN]] is intrinsic to the [[DIALECTICAL_WAVE]] ([[08_DIALECTICS_OF_DUKKHA]] & [[14_COSMIC_INDIFFERENCE-CHAOS]]). [[TRANSCENDENCE]] comes not from eliminating it (impossible) but from _[[UNDERSTANDING]] its [[NECESSITY]]_ and reducing its _[[UNNECESSARY]]_ [[AMPLIFICATION]] through [[EGO_CLINGING]] ([[BUDDHIST_INFLUENCE]] + [[13_KENOSIS]]). "[[GOD]] transmutes [[EVIL]] into [[GOOD]]" via the [[DIALECTICAL_PROCESS]] itself. Connects to [[15_VIRTUE_AS_DIALECTICAL_ALIGNMENT]] and [[31_STOCHASTICITY_AS_COSMIC_CREATIVE_FORCE]].
